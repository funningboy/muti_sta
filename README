hi all:
this is a sample tool for static timing report with gate level verilog.
it only support 2 inputs 1 output in each logic gate, such as AND,OR,NAND....
you can check the logic true table and gate delay definition in tCAD::tTable.

in tTable we define our logic true table with 'P:N' type. P means the pre-time arrival, 
N means the next-time arrival @ each gate input reciver.

ex:
         _______
P : r __|    ___
N : r ______|
@AND =================
             ___
T : r ______|

how to use it?
make ex1 -> run example 1
make ex2 -> run example 2
